## Fishing competition

In the  [third assignment](https://github.com/uit-inf-2202-f18/assignment-3) in [inf-2202-f18](https://uit-inf-2202-f18.github.io/) you built a web service that streams live AIS data from the Norwegian Costal Administration (Kystverket), and that uses reactive programming to augment the AIS data with computed insights and make these insights available to be displayed in real-time in a web browsers.

This type of web services are very relevant for the both the local, national, and international industry. We are therefore arraning a competetion where you can display your solution for two local companies GoFish and Serit IT-partner. There are prizes, pizza, and nice diplomas.

To participate in the competition you need to prepare a 5 minute presentation of your solution. We will judge the solution based on three criteria all of which should be part of the presentation:
1. Code.
2. Beauty.
3. Features.

The jury comprise two members:
1. X from [GoFish](https://gofish.no/gofish-pro)
2. Dag Brattli from [Serit IT-partner](https://serit.no/).
